-- The disc score is a basic score calculated as the difference between the played Disc and the opponent.
-- The heat score is a bit more complicated. It is calculated from three sub scores.
-- The hot, warm, and cold scores. The hot score is calulcated by determining how many 
-- discs occupy any zone marked as 'hot'. That number of discs is multiplied by 2 (subject to change).
-- The same method is used determining the score for other heat zones, but the multiplier is different. 
-- x1 multiplier for warm zones (subject to change) and x(-2) for cold zones (subject to change).
-- I guess there is two ways of doing this. I could calculate the score of each heat zone and add the three scores together.
-- Or I can just get the final heat score in one fell swoop by using filters and some function composition. 
-- Finally, the discScore and heatScore are added together to determine the score of the board state.


-- But wait...This is even better. Get rid of disc score entirely and really on the heatScore alone. But this time
-- also calculate the heat score based on opponent positions. 
-- So, if a square is occupied by A.I.: hot is x2, warm is x1, cold is x(-2)
-- If the square is occupied by the opp: hot is x(-2), warm is x1, cold is x(2)
